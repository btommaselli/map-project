<p>The disruptions in civilians’ daily lives, that came with the 2020 pandemic, led to severe dysfunctional community dynamics and contributed to an increase in criminal activity.
The most alarming criminal activity increase that occurred due to the spread of COVID-19 was the rate of deaths due to gun violence. </p>

<p>“This is a historic increase, with the rate having reached the highest level in over 25 years,” Dr. Debra E. Houry, acting principal deputy director of the C.D.C. and the director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said to the New York Times.</p>

<p>The escalation of fear and uncertainty in people’s lives, by being forced to be isolated and have to worry about job stability, had a terrifying contribution to gun homicides in the year 2020.</p>

<p>Even after the lockdown rule was lifted in 2021, the societal reemergence from stay-at-home measures caused another spike in firearm violence in the United States. Many individuals were still uncertain of their own safety and the safety of their properties, which led to accelerated sales of firearms across the country.</p>

<p>The lowest number of deaths in the year 2020 was 50 in the state of Hawaii, while in 2021 the lowest number of deaths was 64 in the state of Rhode Island. The highest count of firearm deaths appeared to occur in the southern states, with the state of Texas holding the highest number in both years. In 2020, Texas had 4164 deaths, while in 2021 it had an increase of 4613 deaths.</p>
